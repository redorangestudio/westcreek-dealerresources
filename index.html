                Want to explain the West Creek advantage to your customers? Use the following text to describe the benefits of West Creek financing and the application process. Cut and past the copy below on your website.
            </p>

            <h3>West Creek Offers Fast and Easy Payment Option â€“ No Credit Needed</h3>

            <h3>High Approval Rates:</h3>
            <p>
                With West Creek Financial it takes only seconds to get approved for up to $5,000 on a lease-to-own contract. More than 80% of applications are approved &mdash; even those with low credit scores.
            </p>

            <h3>No Hidden Fees:</h3>
            <p>
                This affordable payment option has no hidden fees. Once you sign the contract, a $40 initial payment will be deducted electronically. Then your payments will be automatically withdrawn from your checking account on paydays. Payments are 16.25% of the invoice per month for 12 months. For example, if your invoice amount is $1,000 and you get paid bi-weekly, your payment will be $75 every payday for 26 payments.
            </p>

            <h3>90-Day Purchase Option or Early Buyout:</h3>
            <p>
                And with the 90-day purchase option &mdash; you can choose to purchase the item within 90 days of delivery and pay only the initial $40 payment plus the invoice amount. After 90 days, you may choose the early buyout option and purchase the merchandise at up to 64% of the remaining balance on the lease.
            </p>

            <h3>Requirements</h3>
